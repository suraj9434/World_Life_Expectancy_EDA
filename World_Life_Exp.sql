   1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
   - Clean raw data (remove duplicates, handle missing values, standardize categories).
   - Perform exploratory queries to analyze global health indicators.
   - Extract key insights about GDP, BMI, mortality, and life expectancy trends.

/* ============================================================================================
   4. KEY INSIGHTS
   ============================================================================================
   - Global Progress: Life expectancy has steadily increased worldwide over the years.
   - Wealth & Health: Higher GDP nations consistently achieve longer life spans.
   - Status Gap: Developed countries show higher averages than developing ones. 
		(Note: the data was skewed for developing countries)
   - Health Factors: BMI and Adult Mortality strongly correlate with life expectancy.
